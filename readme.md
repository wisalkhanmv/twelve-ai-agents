# **Twelve AI Agents**

## **Introduction**

Twelve AI Agents is an open-source project designed to simulate real-world decision-making by having AI agents with different personalities discuss problems and collaboratively reach conclusions. Instead of a single AI model providing one answer, this framework enables diverse perspectives to interact, challenge, and refine ideas over multiple discussion rounds.

## **Installation**

To install the Twelve AI Agents package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install twelve-ai-agents
```

## **Usage**

To start the discussion simulation, use the **main_streamlit.py** file:

```bash
python main_streamlit.py
```

This script initializes the AI agents, introduces a dilemma, and orchestrates the conversation rounds where the agents analyze and debate the problem.

## **How It Works**

The Twelve AI Agents represent distinct perspectives in problem-solving:

- **The Visionary** â€“ Long-term thinker
- **The Strategist** â€“ Optimizer and planner
- **The Nurturer** â€“ Ethical and human-centered
- **The Explorer** â€“ Unconventional thinker
- **The Moderator** â€“ Ensures structured discussion
- **The Innovator** â€“ Pushes for creative solutions
- **The Realist** â€“ Pragmatic approach
- **The Advocate** â€“ Focuses on specific interests
- **The Negotiator** â€“ Seeks compromises
- **The Analyst** â€“ Data-driven decision-maker
- **The Optimist** â€“ Highlights opportunities
- **The Pragmatist** â€“ Focuses on feasibility

Each agent adapts and evolves over multiple discussion rounds, making the decision-making process more dynamic.

## **Analysis**

For detailed insights and evaluation of agent discussions, check the **analysis.ipynb** file. This Jupyter Notebook contains:

- Recorded conversations from multiple dilemmas.
- Graphical analysis of agent interactions.
- Trends on consensus-building and divergence.

## **Hugging Face Space**

You can also experiment with Twelve AI Agents directly on Hugging Face Spaces:
