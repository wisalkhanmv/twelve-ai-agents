    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- The purpose of these Agents is to compare the minds of 12 AI Agents making a decision vs one Agent vs Real Humans. It would be interesting to see any see irregularities or findings in deciding on ethical dillemmas or strategic decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agents:\n",
    "- The 12 AI Agents (each with a different personality) would be set in a conversation room. They will be given a social dillema or a complex problem, they’ll collectively decide on an answer. The agents would also have a set of skills. Those can be adjusted according to the problem given to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There would be a conversation among agents in a way where each agent gets to speak in the room like a Jury. The Agent can choose whether to speak or not. The decision making would be purely based on how their personality sees the problem and how logical it is for them to decide on something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dilemmas\n",
    "- The problems would mostly be Social Dilemmas, we’ll compare it to a jury of actual humans with same personalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can go beyond just social dilemmas, the Agents can be used to decide on strategies that would work to achieve a specific goal. An example of a goal can be to devise a marketing strategy for a premium perfume product for ladies. Given all the information about the product, each agent, with their personality + assigned marketing skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even more, the agents can brainstorm an idea and go from a seed of an idea to a drafted document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outcome is evaluation criteria is pure comparison of the conversation and the decision to real human environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The comparison of the AI Agents to a Jury doesn’t mean the agents would have the capability to act as a legal jury but rather a good comparison to how the conversation flow will work."
